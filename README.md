# Audiophile (In development)

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-v.16.15.0-node)

[Audiophile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx) is an advanced project over on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It's a multi-page e-commerce application. The long-term goal is [Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps) integration and adding a backend. I'm documenting my progress [here](./development-diary.md).

For now, whatever I have written about will be in the app in some form, usually as a component. What appears when it starts is anyone's guess as for now I'm still building individual compoents and I use `App.tsx` as a canvas for viewing my components. This application was developed on node `v16.15.0`
