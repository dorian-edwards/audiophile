# Audiophile

[Audiophile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx) is an advanced project over on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It's a multi-page e-commerce application. The long-term goal is [Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps) integration and adding a backend. I'm documenting my progress [here](./development-diary.md).
